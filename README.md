 Because of the current outbreak, COVID-19, we are ordered to be stay at home, and of course we can’t go to school, because of it begins the noneffective online school learning. In our school, student's learning plans are less systematic, confusing, and the learning platform that changes frequently, and there’s lack of communication between students and teachers. We’re think this problem not only implied to us, because we see there’s a lot of student’s out there complaining about the same thing in social media, and that’s where the idea begins. From students for students.
